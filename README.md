<em>Shortly after joing Amazon as an IT Support Engineer II, I was tasked with being assigned the task of launching a sister hub site.  As my first major project assigned with the company, it was a daughting task to say the least.  It was a tall ask from the days of my first intial project.  Remember it like yesterday... putting together a few standup screen stations for floor managers to use during meetings while the world was scrambling to best mitigate the fluidilty of COVID prevention paramaters:
